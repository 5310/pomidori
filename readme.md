# Pomidori

A fancy-smanshy web-based Pomodoro timer and personal learning exercise.

### Why is this?

I love the [Pomodoro](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_technique) “technique” and the ease of [web-based timers](http://ddg.gg/?q=pomodoro+timers).
And since none of the existing crop of web-based pomodoro timers have all the features I want, and because I could use the exercise, I’m making one myself!

[And this is it](http://5310.github.com/pomidori). Pretty huh? And it does, or will in the eventual future, feature the following:

### Features, Present and Future

-   Open web standards FTW! No pesky flash for audio.
-   Pretty visuals using HTML+Javascript+CSS, and [Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/)! Throw in your own favorite JS library too!
-   Canvas visualization as favicon!
-   No cookie-clutter, reads settings off the url. This is undocumented at the moment, and is a bit geeky without UI.
-   Url can be bookmarked with custom settings.
-   Eventually, when a proper UI is implemented, it'll be possibly to pause resume and continue timers across sessions...maybe.
-   Skinnable! Although only for those willing to geek a bit. And skin changing isn't implemented yet! This part I'll get done soonish...

And I also love the [color green](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/midori), among others.
